Assignment on FSM
Done by Igor Sorogovecs

This app simulates basic AI of grass, sheep and wolves using FSM (finite state machines)


Grass is growing and spreading when it reaches certain size

Sheep is wandering around looking for grass, creates more sheep after eating enough grass and actively escapes wolves

Wolf is looking for sheep to eat and creates more wolves upon eatin enough sheep

Number on entities shows their life value (if it reaches 0 entity dies)
